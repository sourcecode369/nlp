### Introduction


> *Datasets and evaluation metrics for natural language processing.
Compatible with NumPy, Pandas, PyTorch and TensorFlow*

ðŸ¤— nlp is a lightweight and extensible library to easily share and access datasets and evaluation metrics for Natural Language Processing (NLP).

`nlp` has many interesting features (beside easy sharing and accessing datasets/metrics):

* Built-in interoperability with Numpy, Pandas, PyTorch and Tensorflow 2
* Lightweight and fast with a transparent and pythonic API
* Strive on large datasets: nlp naturally frees the user from RAM memory limitation, all datasets are memory-mapped on drive by default.
* Smart caching: never wait for your data to process several times

`nlp` currently provides access to ~100 NLP datasets and ~10 evaluation metrics and is designed to let the community easily add and share new datasets and evaluation metrics. 

This repository contains notebooks and .py to guide using and data preprocessing techniques using `nlp` lbrary.
