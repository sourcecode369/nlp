# HuggingFace `nlp` library - Quick overview

Models come and go (linear models, LSTM, Transformers, ...) but two core elements have consistently been the beating heart of Natural Language Processing: Datasets & Metrics

`nlp` is a lightweight and extensible library to easily share and load dataset and evaluation metrics, already providing access to ~100 datasets and ~10 evaluation metrics.

The library has several interesting features (beside easy access to datasets/metrics):

- Build-in interoperability with PyTorch, Tensorflow 2, Pandas and Numpy
- Small and fast library with a transparent and pythonic API
- Strive on large datasets: nlp naturally frees you from RAM memory limits, all datasets are memory-mapped on drive by default.
- Smart caching with an intelligent `tf.data`-like cache: never wait for your data to process several times

`nlp` originated from a fork of the awesome Tensorflow-Datasets and the HuggingFace team want to deeply thank the team behind this amazing library and user API. We have tried to keep a layer of compatibility with `tfds` and a conversion can provide conversion from one format to the other.

# Main datasets API

"""This call to `nlp.load_dataset()` does the following steps under the hood:

1. Download and import in the library the **SQuAD python processing script** from HuggingFace AWS bucket if it's not already stored in the library. You can find the SQuAD processing script [here](https://github.com/huggingface/nlp/tree/master/datasets/squad/squad.py) for instance.

   Processing scripts are small python scripts which define the info (citation, description) and format of the dataset and contain the URL to the original SQuAD JSON files and the code to load examples from the original SQuAD JSON files.


2. Run the SQuAD python processing script which will:
    - **Download the SQuAD dataset** from the original URL (see the script) if it's not already downloaded and cached.
    - **Process and cache** all SQuAD in a structured Arrow table for each standard splits stored on the drive.

      Arrow table are arbitrarly long tables, typed with types that can be mapped to numpy/pandas/python standard types and can store nested objects. They can be directly access from drive, loaded in RAM or even streamed over the web.
    

3. Return a **dataset build from the splits** asked by the user (default: all), in the above example we create a dataset with the first 10% of the validation split.

"""The `__getitem__` method will return different format depending on the type of query:

- Items like `dataset[0]` are returned as dict of elements.
- Slices like `dataset[10:20]` are returned as dict of lists of elements.
- Columns like `dataset['question']` are returned as a list of elements.

This may seems surprising at first but in our experiments it's actually a lot easier to use for data processing than returning the same format for each of these views on the dataset.

In particular, you can easily iterate along columns in slices, and also naturally permute consecutive indexings with identical results as showed here by permuting column indexing with elements and slices:

"""## Cache

`nlp` datasets are backed by Apache Arrow cache files which allows:
- to load arbitrary large datasets by using [memory mapping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory-mapped_file) (as long as the datasets can fit on the drive)
- to use a fast backend to process the dataset efficiently
- to do smart caching by storing and reusing the results of operations performed on the drive

Let's dive a bit in these parts now

You can check the current cache files backing the dataset with the `.cache_file` property
"""

"""You can clean up the cache files in the current dataset directory (only keeping the currently used one) with `.cleanup_cache_files()`.

Be careful that no other process is using some other cache files when running this command.

"""## Modifying the dataset with `dataset.map`

There is a powerful method `.map()` which is inspired by `tf.data` map method and that you can use to apply a function to each examples, independently or in batch.
"""

# `.map()` takes a callable accepting a dict as argument
# (same dict as returned by dataset[i])
# and iterate over the dataset by calling the function with each example.

# Let's print the length of each `context` string in our subset of the dataset
# (10% of the validation i.e. 1057 examples)

dataset.map(lambda example: print(len(example['context']), end=','))

"""This is basically the same as doing

```python
for example in dataset:
    function(example)
```

The above example had no effect on the dataset because the method we supplied to `.map()` didn't return a `dict` or a `abc.Mapping` that could be used to update the examples in the dataset.

In such a case, `.map()` will return the same dataset (`self`).

Now let's see how we can use a method that actually modify the dataset.

### Modifying the dataset example by example

The main interest of `.map()` is to update and modify the content of the table and leverage smart caching and fast backend.

To use `.map()` to update elements in the table you need to provide a function with the following signature: `function(example: dict) -> dict`.
"""

# Let's add a prefix 'My cute title: ' to each of our titles

def add_prefix_to_title(example):
    example['title'] = 'My cute title: ' + example['title']
    return example

dataset = dataset.map(add_prefix_to_title)

print(dataset.unique('title'))

"""This call to `.map()` compute and return the updated table. It will also store the updated table in a cache file indexed by the current state and the mapped function.

A subsequent call to `.map()` (even in another python session) will reuse the cached file instead of recomputing the operation.

You can test this by running again the previous cell, you will see that the result are directly loaded from the cache and not re-computed again.

The updated dataset returned by `.map()` is (again) directly memory mapped from drive and not allocated in RAM.

The function you provide to `.map()` should accept an input with the format of an item of the dataset: `function(dataset[0])` and return a python dict.

The columns and type of the outputs can be different than the input dict. In this case the new keys will be added as additional columns in the dataset.

Bascially each dataset example dict is updated with the dictionary returned by the function like this: `example.update(function(example))`.
"""

# Since the input example dict is updated with our function output dict,
# we can actually just return the updated 'title' field
dataset = dataset.map(lambda example: {'title': 'My cutest title: ' + example['title']})

print(dataset.unique('title'))

"""#### Removing columns
You can also remove columns when running map with the `remove_columns=List[str]` argument.
"""

# This will remove the 'title' column while doing the update (after having send it the the mapped function so you can use it in your function!)
dataset = dataset.map(lambda example: {'new_title': 'Wouhahh: ' + example['title']},
                     remove_columns=['title'])

print(dataset.column_names)
print(dataset.unique('new_title'))

"""#### Using examples indices
With `with_indices=True`, dataset indices (from `0` to `len(dataset)`) will be supplied to the function which must thus have the following signature: `function(example: dict, indice: int) -> dict`
"""

# This will add the index in the dataset to the 'question' field
dataset = dataset.map(lambda example, idx: {'question': f'{idx}: ' + example['question']},
                      with_indices=True)

print('\n'.join(dataset['question'][:5]))

"""### Modifying the dataset with batched updates

`.map()` can also work with batch of examples (slices of the dataset).

This is particularly interesting if you have a function that can handle batch of inputs like the tokenizers of HuggingFace `tokenizers`.

To work on batched inputs set `batched=True` when calling `.map()` and supply a function with the following signature: `function(examples: Dict[List]) -> Dict[List]` or, if you use indices, `function(examples: Dict[List], indices: List[int]) -> Dict[List]`).

Bascially, your function should accept an input with the format of a slice of the dataset: `function(dataset[:10])`.

"""## Formating outputs for numpy/torch/tensorflow

Now that we have tokenized our inputs, we probably want to use this dataset in a `torch.Dataloader` or a `tf.data.Dataset`.

To be able to do this we need to tweak two things:

- format the indexing (`__getitem__`) to return numpy/pytorch/tensorflow tensors, instead of python objects, and probably
- format the indexing (`__getitem__`) to return only the subset of the columns that we need for our model inputs.

  We don't want the columns `id` or `title` as inputs to train our model, but we could still want to keep them in the dataset, for instance for the evaluation of the model.
    
This is handled by the `.set_format(type: Union[None, str], columns: Union[None, str, List[str]])` where:

- `type` define the return type for our dataset `__getitem__` method and is one of `[None, 'numpy', 'pandas', 'torch', 'tensorflow']` (`None` means return python objects), and
- `columns` define the columns returned by `__getitem__` and takes the name of a column in the dataset or a list of columns to return (`None` means return all columns).

"""# Metrics API

`nlp` also provides easy access and sharing of metrics.

This aspect of the library is still experimental and the API may still evolve more than the datasets API.

Like datasets, metrics are added as small scripts wrapping common metrics in a common API.

There are several reason you may want to use metrics with `nlp` and in particular:

- metrics for specific datasets like GLUE or SQuAD are provided out-of-the-box in a simple, convenient and consistant way integrated with the dataset,
- metrics in `nlp` leverage the powerful backend to provide smart features out-of-the-box like support for distributed evaluation in PyTorch

## Using metrics

Using metrics is pretty simple, they have two main methods: `.compute(predictions, references)` to directly compute the metric and `.add(prediction, reference)` or `.add_batch(predictions, references)` to only store some results if you want to do the evaluation in one go at the end.

Here is a quick gist of a standard use of metrics (the simplest usage):
```python
import nlp
bleu_metric = nlp.load_metric('bleu')

# If you only have a single iteration, you can easily compute the score like this
predictions = model(inputs)
score = bleu_metric.compute(predictions, references)

# If you have a loop, you can "add" your predictions and references at each iteration instead of having to save them yourself (the metric object store them efficiently for you)
for batch in dataloader:
    model_input, targets = batch
    predictions = model(model_inputs)
    bleu_metric.add_batch(predictions, targets)
score = bleu_metric.compute()  # Compute the score from all the stored predictions/references
```

Here is a quick gist of a use in a distributed torch setup (should work for any python multi-process setup actually). It's pretty much identical to the second example above:
```python
import nlp
# You need to give the total number of parallel python processes (num_process) and the id of each process (process_id)
bleu_metric = nlp.load_metric('bleu', process_id=torch.distributed.get_rank(),b num_process=torch.distributed.get_world_size())

for batch in dataloader:
    model_input, targets = batch
    predictions = model(model_inputs)
    bleu_metric.add_batch(predictions, targets)
score = bleu_metric.compute()  # Compute the score on the first node by default (can be set to compute on each node as well)
```

Example with a NER metric: `seqeval`
"""

ner_metric = nlp.load_metric('seqeval')
references = [['O', 'O', 'O', 'B-MISC', 'I-MISC', 'I-MISC', 'O'], ['B-PER', 'I-PER', 'O']]
predictions =  [['O', 'O', 'B-MISC', 'I-MISC', 'I-MISC', 'I-MISC', 'O'], ['B-PER', 'I-PER', 'O']]
ner_metric.compute(predictions, references)

"""# Adding a new dataset or a new metric

They are two ways to add new datasets and metrics in `nlp`:

- datasets can be added with a Pull-Request adding a script in the `datasets` folder of the [`nlp` repository](https://github.com/huggingface/nlp)

=> once the PR is merged, the dataset can be instantiate by it's folder name e.g. `nlp.load_dataset('squad')`. If you want HuggingFace to host the data as well you will need to ask the HuggingFace team to upload the data.

- datasets can also be added with a direct upload using `nlp` CLI as a user or organization (like for models in `transformers`). In this case the dataset will be accessible under the gien user/organization name, e.g. `nlp.load_dataset('thomwolf/squad')`. In this case you can upload the data yourself at the same time and in the same folder.

We will add a full tutorial on how to add and upload datasets soon.
